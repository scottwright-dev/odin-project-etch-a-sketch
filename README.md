### Description

This is an implementation of the classic drawing toy "Etch-a-Sketch" using JavaScript and HTML. The program creates a grid of squares in a container, and the user can hover over the squares to draw on the canvas. The user can also use the "New Grid" button to generate a new canvas with a different size and the "Erase" button to clear the canvas.

### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

### Features

- A grid of squares is created using vanilla JavaScript and HTML
- The grid size can be set by the user using the "New Grid" button
- The program uses event listeners to capture user input and update the grid
- A color hover effect is added to each square to create a drawing experience
- A function is added to allow the user to erase their drawing using the "Erase" button.

### Challenges

- Updating the grid to the user-specified size while keeping the square aspect ratio required adjusting the grid-template-columns and calculating the size of each square dynamically
- Generating random pastel colors for each square and adding blackness to the color was a challenge. It required working with the RGB color model and manipulating color components to achieve the desired effect.

### Thoughts and Observations

Creating the grid and handling user input were relatively straightforward tasks, but adding color and blackness to the squares certainly required a lot of thought and experimentation. However, I found the process of creating a dynamic interface and implementing color manipulation to be rewarding. 

The project reminded me of the importance of planning and breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps. It also helped to reinforce the importance of testing and debugging my code regularly to catch any errors and ensure that the program is functioning as expected.

### Conclusion

The project provided an opportunity for me to practice fundamental JavaScript skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and user input validation. The addition of a more dynamic UI made the program more user-friendly and engaging. Future plans for the project include additional further UI styling.
