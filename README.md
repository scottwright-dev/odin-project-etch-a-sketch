### Description

A browser based interactive Etch-a-Sketch webpage game built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### Initial Requirements

- [ ] Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
- [ ] Create the divs using JavaScript. 
- [ ] Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change colour when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid as a pen would.
- [ ] Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
